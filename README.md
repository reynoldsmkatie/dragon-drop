### Description:
After learning how to create drag-and-drop elements from a fun LinkedIn Learning tutorial called "JavaScript: Events" by Ray Villalobos, I decided to create my own drag-and-drop game, appropriately name "Dragon Drop". I used HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript with a focus on event listeners. The game is also available as a web app.

### Game Synopsis:
A dragon is hoarding all your money! You have 10 seconds to drag as many coins as you can into your vault.
